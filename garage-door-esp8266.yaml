# INTRODUCTION
# 
# This ESPHome based firmware configuration is designed for the Konnected Garage Door Opener v1,
# but can also run on any ESP8266 device. The Garage Door Opener retrofits an older style traditional
# garage door opener and has the following features which are included as packages below:
#
# 1. Wired contact sensor for detecting open/closed state of garage door
# 2. Optical range sensor for detecting open/closed state of garage door
# 3. Emulates a garage door opener button wired to a dry contact relay to open/close the garage door.
# 4. Adds a Garage Door "Cover" entity that is exposed to Home Assistant. The cover entity incorporates the state of the 
#    garage door and controls to open/close/stop it.
# 5. Flashes an onboard LED and beeps an onboard piezo sounder as a warning before automatically closing.
